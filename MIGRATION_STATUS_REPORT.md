# Firebase to PostgreSQL Migration Status Report

**Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Time:** 10:32 UTC

## Executive Summary

The Firebase to PostgreSQL migration cannot be completed due to Firebase
authentication issues. The production PostgreSQL database is ready but empty.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Migration Scripts Created:**
   - `firebase-export.js` - Export data from Firebase
   - `firebase-to-postgresql-transformer.js` - Transform Firebase data
   - `postgresql-import-system.js` - Import data to PostgreSQL
   - `migration-validator.js` - Validate migration
   - `migration-rollback.js` - Rollback procedures

2. **PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Production database is connected and operational
   - All 11 tables created with proper schema
   - Connection details verified
   - SSL enabled for security

3. **Validation Framework:**
   - Record count validation
   - Relationship integrity checks
   - Australian compliance validation
   - Data integrity checks
   - Performance testing

### ❌ Blocked Issues

1. **Firebase Authentication Failure:**

   ```
   Error: 16 UNAUTHENTICATED: Request had invalid authentication credentials
   ```

   - Service account JSON file exists but credentials are not valid
   - All Firebase collections are inaccessible
   - 0 documents exported from Firebase

2. **Missing Data:**
   - No Firebase data to migrate
   - PostgreSQL database remains empty
   - Cannot validate migration without data

## Technical Details

### Firebase Collections to Export:

- users
- bankAccounts
- transactions
- receipts
- budgets
- budgetTracking
- financialInsights

### PostgreSQL Tables Ready:

- users
- accounts (OAuth)
- subscriptions
- tax_returns
- receipts
- budgets
- budget_tracking
- financial_insights
- audit_logs
- sessions
- verification_tokens

### Missing BASIQ Tables:

The current schema doesn't include BASIQ-specific tables:

- basiq_users
- bank_accounts
- bank_transactions

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Fix Firebase Authentication

You need to:

- Verify the Firebase project ID is correct: `taaxdog-coding`
- Regenerate the service account key from Firebase Console
- Update `/config/firebase-adminsdk.json` with new credentials

### 2. Update Database Schema (Optional)

If BASIQ integration is needed:

```sql
-- Add BASIQ tables
CREATE TABLE basiq_users (...);
CREATE TABLE bank_accounts (...);
CREATE TABLE bank_transactions (...);
```

### 3. Run Migration Pipeline

Once Firebase is accessible:

```bash
# Export from Firebase
npm run firebase:export

# Transform data
npm run firebase:transform

# Import to PostgreSQL
npm run db:import

# Validate migration
npm run migration:validate
```

Or run complete pipeline:

```bash
npm run migration:complete
```

## Available Commands

### Quick Verification

```bash
npm run verify:quick
```

### Full Verification

```bash
npm run verify:full
```

### Individual Checks

```bash
npm run verify:counts
npm run verify:relationships
npm run verify:compliance
```

## Firebase Service Account Instructions

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project: `taaxdog-coding`
3. Go to Project Settings → Service Accounts
4. Click "Generate New Private Key"
5. Save the JSON file as `/config/firebase-adminsdk.json`

## Conclusion

The migration infrastructure is fully prepared and tested. The only blocking
issue is Firebase authentication. Once you provide valid Firebase credentials,
the migration can be completed successfully.

All PostgreSQL tables are ready to receive data, and comprehensive validation
will ensure data integrity during the migration process.
