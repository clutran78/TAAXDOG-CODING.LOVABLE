## üõ†Ô∏è PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
# Install production dependencies
pip install -r requirements-production.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp production.env .env
# Edit .env with your production values
```

### Step 2: Infrastructure Dependencies

```bash
# Start Redis (required for caching and rate limiting)
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Or use Redis Cloud/AWS ElastiCache for production
```

### Step 3: Database Setup

```bash
# Initialize production database indexes
python backend/database/production_setup.py

# Verify database health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health/detailed
```

### Step 4: Security Configuration

```bash
# Configure rate limiting and security
# Update backend/security/production_security.py with your settings

# Test security endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health/security
```

### Step 5: Load Testing

```bash
# Install load testing tools
pip install locust

# Run load tests
cd tests/performance
locust -f load_test.py --headless -u 50 -r 5 -t 300s --host=http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 6: Production Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy with Docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# Or deploy using the CI/CD pipeline
git push origin main  # Triggers automated deployment
```
