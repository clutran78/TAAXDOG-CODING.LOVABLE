# Security Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive security enhancements implemented for
the TAAXDOG application, including Row-Level Security (RLS) and field-level
encryption.

## 1. Row-Level Security (RLS)

### What's Implemented

- **Database-level security** on 13 sensitive tables
- **Automatic user isolation** - users can only access their own data
- **Admin bypass policies** for administrative access
- **Performance-optimized** with proper indexes

### Protected Tables

- `users` - User profiles and authentication
- `goals` - Financial goals
- `receipts` - Tax receipts and documents
- `bank_transactions` - Banking transaction data
- `bank_accounts` - Bank account information
- `bank_connections` - Banking API connections
- `budgets` - Budget planning data
- `budget_tracking` - Budget tracking records
- `tax_returns` - Tax return data
- `financial_insights` - AI-generated insights
- `ai_conversations` - AI chat history
- `ai_insights` - AI analysis results
- `ai_usage_tracking` - AI usage metrics

### How It Works

1. Each API request sets a PostgreSQL session variable with the current user ID
2. RLS policies automatically filter queries to show only the user's data
3. No manual WHERE clauses needed in application code
4. Admin users can see all data through bypass policies

### Benefits

- **Bulletproof security** - Even if application code has bugs, database
  enforces access control
- **Cleaner code** - Remove repetitive userId checks
- **Performance** - Optimized with indexes on foreign keys
- **Compliance** - Guaranteed data isolation for privacy regulations

## 2. Field-Level Encryption

### What's Implemented

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for sensitive fields
- **Automatic encryption/decryption** via Prisma middleware
- **Transparent to application** - Works seamlessly with existing code

### Encrypted Fields

#### User Table

- `tfn` - Tax File Number
- `twoFactorSecret` - 2FA authentication secret

#### Bank Accounts

- `accountNumber` - Bank account numbers
- `bsb` - Bank State Branch codes

#### Receipts

- `taxInvoiceNumber` - Tax invoice identifiers
- `abn` - Australian Business Numbers

#### Basiq Users

- `mobile` - Phone numbers

#### Bank Transactions

- `description` - Transaction descriptions (optional)

### How It Works

1. Prisma middleware intercepts database operations
2. Before saving: Sensitive fields are encrypted
3. After reading: Encrypted fields are decrypted
4. Encryption key stored in environment variable
5. Uses authenticated encryption (AES-256-GCM)

### Benefits

- **Data at rest protection** - Sensitive data encrypted in database
- **Transparent operation** - No code changes needed
- **Key rotation support** - Can re-encrypt with new keys
- **Compliance ready** - Meets data protection requirements

## 3. Migration Status

### Completed ✅

- [x] RLS migration applied to production database
- [x] RLS middleware created and tested
- [x] Field-level encryption library implemented
- [x] Prisma encryption middleware created
- [x] Example API routes migrated to RLS
- [x] Migration scripts and guides created

### API Routes Updated

- [x] `/api/goals/*` - Goals management (example created)
- [x] `/api/receipts/*` - Receipt processing (example created)
- [ ] `/api/budgets/*` - Budget tracking (pending)
- [ ] `/api/banking/*` - Banking transactions (pending)
- [ ] `/api/ai/*` - AI services (pending)
- [ ] `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints (pending)
- [ ] `/api/stripe/*` - Payment processing (pending)

## 4. Security Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Database connection (with SSL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?sslmode=require"

# Field encryption key (32-byte hex string)
FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-64-character-hex-key-here"

# NextAuth secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
```

### Generate Encryption Key

```bash
# Generate a new encryption key
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## 5. Testing & Verification

### Test RLS Implementation

```bash
npm run test-rls
```

### Encrypt Existing Data

```bash
# Dry run
npx ts-node scripts/encrypt-existing-data.ts

# Execute encryption
npx ts-node scripts/encrypt-existing-data.ts --force
```

### Verify Security

1. **RLS Test**: Create two test users and verify data isolation
2. **Encryption Test**: Check that sensitive fields are encrypted in database
3. **Performance Test**: Monitor query performance with RLS enabled
4. **Admin Test**: Verify admin users can access all data

## 6. Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always use RLS middleware** for user data endpoints
2. **Never bypass RLS** in production code
3. **Keep encryption keys secure** - Never commit to git
4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify data access patterns
5. **Monitor performance** - Watch for slow queries

### For Operations

1. **Backup encryption keys** securely
2. **Rotate keys periodically** (quarterly recommended)
3. **Monitor failed access attempts** in logs
4. **Audit admin access** regularly
5. **Keep RLS policies updated** when adding tables

## 7. Rollback Procedures

### Disable RLS (Emergency Only)

```sql
-- Disable RLS on specific table
ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all policies
DROP POLICY ALL ON table_name;
```

### Decrypt Data

```typescript
// Use the batch decryption script
npx ts-node scripts/decrypt-all-data.ts
```

## 8. Compliance Benefits

### Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)

- ✅ APP 11 - Security of personal information
- ✅ Data isolation between users
- ✅ Encryption of sensitive fields
- ✅ Access control and audit trails

### Tax Compliance

- ✅ TFN encryption
- ✅ ABN protection
- ✅ Tax document security
- ✅ Financial data isolation

## 9. Performance Considerations

### Indexes Added

- User role for admin checks
- Foreign keys used in RLS policies
- Commonly queried fields

### Optimization Tips

- Use connection pooling
- Monitor slow query logs
- Consider read replicas for reporting
- Cache decrypted data in application memory

## 10. Future Enhancements

### Planned

- [ ] Key rotation automation
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Data masking for support access
- [ ] Encryption for file attachments
- [ ] Hardware security module (HSM) integration

### Considered

- Column-level encryption in PostgreSQL
- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Client-side encryption for ultra-sensitive data
- Zero-knowledge architecture for passwords
