# Taaxdog Authentication System - Setup Complete ✅

## Summary

All 4 deployment tasks have been successfully completed:

### 1. ✅ Database Migration

- Created all authentication tables in PostgreSQL
- Tables created: users, accounts, sessions, verification_tokens, audit_logs,
  subscriptions, tax_returns
- Migration file:
  `migrations/20250701040837_add_authentication_tables/migration.sql`

### 2. ✅ Google OAuth Setup

- Created setup guide at `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`
- Made Google OAuth optional in the configuration
- System works with email/password authentication without Google OAuth

### 3. ✅ Environment Variables Configured

- Development database configured and connected
- NextAuth secret keys set for development and production
- All API keys from CLAUDE.md included
- Configuration split between `.env` and `.env.local`

### 4. ✅ Authentication System Tested

- Database connection verified
- Password validation tested (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special
  chars)
- Account lockout mechanism verified (locks after 5 failed attempts)
- Audit logging functional
- Test script created at `scripts/test-auth.ts`
- All tests passed successfully

## How to Test the Authentication Flow

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit the test page:** http://localhost:3000/test-auth

3. **Test registration:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/register
   - Fill in the form with Australian tax residency options
   - Use a strong password (12+ chars with mixed case, numbers, special chars)

4. **Test login:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
   - Use your registered credentials
   - Try wrong password 5 times to test lockout

5. **Protected routes:**
   - `/dashboard` - requires authentication
   - `/admin` - requires ADMIN role
   - `/profile` - requires authentication

## Key Features Implemented

### Security

- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- ✅ Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (30 minutes)
- ✅ Rate limiting (100 req/min general, 5 registrations/min)
- ✅ CSRF protection on sensitive endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive security headers
- ✅ Audit logging for all auth events

### Australian Compliance

- ✅ Tax residency status capture
- ✅ ABN field with validation
- ✅ TFN field (for encrypted storage)
- ✅ Australian design standards
- ✅ GST-compliant pricing structure

### Authentication Methods

- ✅ Email/Password authentication
- ✅ Google OAuth (optional, requires configuration)
- ✅ JWT-based sessions (30-day expiration)
- ✅ Role-based access control (USER, ACCOUNTANT, SUPPORT, ADMIN)

## Next Steps

1. **For Production:**
   - Set up Google OAuth credentials
   - Use production database URL
   - Deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Set up monitoring for audit logs

2. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Email verification flow
   - Password reset functionality
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Social login providers (Facebook, Microsoft)
   - Session management UI
