## Critical Path to Production

### üö® Must Fix Before Deployment:

1. **Environment Variables** (1 hour)
   - Create production `.env` file with all required variables
   - Ensure all API keys are production keys
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production`

2. **System Resources** (2 hours)
   - Free up memory (target: <80% usage)
   - Clean disk space (target: <70% usage)
   - Restart services to clear memory

3. **Database SSL** (30 minutes)
   - Configure proper SSL certificate for database
   - Update DATABASE_URL with `?sslmode=require`

4. **Email Service** (30 minutes)
   - Configure SendGrid API key
   - Verify sender domain
   - Test email delivery

5. **Backup Configuration** (1 hour)
   - Set up AWS S3 bucket
   - Configure access keys
   - Test backup and restore

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items:

1. **Memory constraints** - May cause deployment failures
2. **Missing security keys** - Could compromise system security
3. **No email service** - Users cannot receive notifications

### Medium Risk Items:

1. **Disk space at 90%** - Limited room for growth
2. **No Google OAuth** - Reduced authentication options
3. **Backup not configured** - No disaster recovery

### Mitigation Plan:

1. Address all high-risk items before deployment
2. Have rollback plan ready
3. Monitor closely during first 48 hours
4. Have on-call team ready
