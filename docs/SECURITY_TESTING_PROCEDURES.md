# Security Testing and Validation Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security testing and validation procedures for TAAXDOG, ensuring compliance with Australian privacy laws and financial industry security standards.

## Security Testing Components

### 1. Security Validation (`npm run security:validate`)

Automated security checklist that validates:

#### Encryption
- ✅ Database SSL/TLS encryption
- ✅ Sensitive field encryption (2FA secrets, API keys)
- ✅ Password hashing (bcrypt with proper rounds)
- ✅ Backup encryption configuration

#### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ RLS enabled on all user data tables
- ✅ Proper security policies configured
- ✅ Policy testing for data isolation

#### API Security
- ✅ Rate limiting on all endpoints
- ✅ Critical endpoint protection
- ✅ Authentication requirements

#### Audit Logging
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail
- ✅ Critical event logging
- ✅ Log retention and integrity

#### Authentication & Session Management
- ✅ Strong password requirements
- ✅ 2FA for privileged users
- ✅ Account lockout policies
- ✅ Secure session configuration

#### Input Validation
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ CSRF protection

#### Network Security
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement
- ✅ Security headers configuration
- ✅ Port security

### 2. Penetration Testing (`npm run security:pentest`)

Simulated attack scenarios including:

#### Authentication Attacks
- SQL injection in login
- NoSQL injection attempts
- JWT manipulation
- Default credential testing
- Brute force protection

#### Input Validation Tests
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Command injection
- Path traversal attacks

#### Access Control Tests
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Privilege escalation attempts
- API access control bypass

#### Session Management
- Session fixation
- Concurrent session handling
- CSRF protection validation

#### Business Logic
- Price manipulation
- Race condition exploitation

### 3. Compliance Verification (`npm run security:compliance`)

Validates compliance with:

#### Australian Privacy Act (13 APPs)
- APP 1: Privacy policy and transparency
- APP 3: Collection of personal information
- APP 5: Notification requirements
- APP 6: Use and disclosure restrictions
- APP 7: Direct marketing compliance
- APP 8: Cross-border data handling
- APP 11: Security of personal information
- APP 12: Access to personal information
- APP 13: Correction capabilities

#### Financial Security Standards
- PCI DSS compliance (via Stripe)
- No card data storage
- Financial data encryption
- Transaction integrity
- Comprehensive audit trail

#### Data Residency Requirements
- Australian hosting verification
- Backup location compliance
- Third-party service compliance

### 4. Security Monitoring (`npm run security:monitor`)

Real-time threat detection:

#### Authentication Monitoring
- Failed login attempts
- New location logins
- Concurrent sessions

#### Authorization Monitoring
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Privilege escalation detection

#### Suspicious Activity Detection
- Rapid API requests (DoS)
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Injection attack patterns
- Account takeover indicators

#### Vulnerability Scanning
- Outdated sessions
- Weak password detection
- Missing 2FA on privileged accounts
- Unencrypted sensitive data

## Running Security Tests

### Quick Security Check
```bash
# Run basic security validation
npm run security:validate
```

### Full Security Audit
```bash
# Run complete security and compliance tests
npm run security:full-test
```

### Penetration Testing
```bash
# Run against local environment
npm run security:pentest

# Run against specific URL
npm run security:pentest https://staging.taxreturnpro.com.au
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Start security monitoring service
npm run security:monitor

# View monitoring dashboard
npm run security:monitor:dashboard
```

### Security Dashboard

## Security Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Security Score**: Target ≥ 90/100
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Must be 0
- **Failed Login Rate**: < 5% of total attempts
- **2FA Adoption**: 100% for privileged users
- **Audit Coverage**: 100% of critical actions

### Risk Scoring
- **0-30**: Critical risk - Immediate action required
- **31-60**: High risk - Address within 24 hours
- **61-89**: Medium risk - Address within 7 days
- **90-100**: Low risk - Normal operations

## Incident Response

### Security Event Classification
1. **Critical**: Data breach, system compromise
2. **High**: Multiple failed auth attempts, privilege escalation
3. **Medium**: Suspicious activity patterns
4. **Low**: Configuration changes, normal failures

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Block threats, lock accounts
4. **Eradication**: Remove vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review
