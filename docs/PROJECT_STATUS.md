- ✅ Subscription management with trials
- ✅ Comprehensive financial analytics

## Performance Metrics

### Application Performance
- **API Response Time**: <100ms average
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with indexes and caching
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with code splitting
- **Core Web Vitals**: Meeting good thresholds

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ across the codebase
- **TypeScript Coverage**: 100% strict mode compliance
- **ESLint Issues**: 0 errors, minimal warnings
- **Bundle Analysis**: Available via `npm run analyze-bundle`

## Security Status

### Current Security Measures
- ✅ Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL
- ✅ Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- ✅ Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Security headers configured
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Compliance
- ✅ Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)
- ✅ AML/CTF requirements
- ✅ PCI DSS for payment processing
- ✅ APRA guidelines for financial data

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Technical Debt
1. Legacy Python Flask backend needs migration
2. Some components could benefit from further optimization
3. Additional test coverage for edge cases

### Performance Considerations
1. Large dataset queries need pagination optimization
2. Real-time updates could use WebSocket implementation
3. Image optimization for user uploads

## Roadmap

### Short Term (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Migrate remaining Flask endpoints to Next.js
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Add more comprehensive E2E tests
- [ ] Enhance mobile app experience

### Medium Term (Q4 2025)

- [ ] Advanced tax optimization features
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Enterprise features (teams, permissions)

### Long Term (2026)
- [ ] Native mobile applications
- [ ] International market expansion
- [ ] Advanced AI financial advisor
- [ ] Blockchain integration for audit trails
