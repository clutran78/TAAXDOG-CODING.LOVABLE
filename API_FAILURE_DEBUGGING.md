# 🎯 API Failure Debugging - App Running But Auth/Email Failing

## ✅ **Good News**

- App is running properly ✅
- Frontend loads correctly ✅
- Pages are accessible ✅
- Environment variables are set ✅

## ❌ **Specific Issues Identified**

- **Sign-up fails**: "Signup failed. Please try again."
- **Password reset fails**: "Failed to send reset email. Please try again."

## 🔍 **This Tells Us The Problem Is:**

- **NOT** app startup issues
- **NOT** environment variable scope
- **Specific API endpoint failures** at runtime

## 📱 **Browser Developer Tools Debugging**

Since the app is working but APIs are failing, let's see the actual errors:

### **Step 1: Open Developer Tools**

1. **Press F12** (or right-click → Inspect)
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Clear any existing entries** (click the clear button)

### **Step 2: Test Sign-Up with Network Monitoring**

1. **Keep Developer Tools open with Network tab active**
2. **Go to sign-up page**: https://dev.taxreturnpro.com.au/sign-up
3. **Fill in the form and submit**
4. **Look in Network tab for:**
   - **Red/failed requests** (they'll be highlighted in red)
   - **Click on any failed requests** to see details
   - **Look for `/api/auth/register` or similar**

### **Step 3: Test Password Reset with Network Monitoring**

1. **Keep Developer Tools Network tab open**
2. **Go to forgot password**: https://dev.taxreturnpro.com.au/forgot-password
3. **Enter email and submit**
4. **Look for failed API calls** in Network tab
5. **Click on failed requests** to see error details

### **Step 4: Check Console for JavaScript Errors**

1. **Go to Console tab** in Developer Tools
2. **Try sign-up or password reset**
3. **Look for red error messages**

## 🚨 **Most Likely Issues Based on Symptoms**

### **Issue A: Database Connection Failing at Runtime**

**Symptoms**: Sign-up fails (can't create user in database) **Check**: Look for
500 errors on `/api/auth/register`

### **Issue B: Email Service Configuration Problem**

**Symptoms**: Password reset fails (can't send email) **Check**: Look for errors
on `/api/auth/forgot-password`

### **Issue C: NextAuth Configuration Issue**

**Symptoms**: Both auth operations fail **Check**: NEXTAUTH_SECRET or
NEXTAUTH_URL mismatch

## 🔧 **Quick API Test**

Try these direct API calls in a new browser tab:

### **Test 1: Auth Providers**

Go to: `https://dev.taxreturnpro.com.au/api/auth/providers`

- **Expected**: JSON response with auth providers
- **If redirects to login**: API protection working (normal)
- **If 500 error**: Auth configuration issue

### **Test 2: Try a Simple API Health Check**

Try: `https://dev.taxreturnpro.com.au/api/health`

- **Expected**: Some JSON response or 404 (normal if endpoint doesn't exist)
- **If 500 error**: General runtime issue

## 📞 **What to Check and Report**

Please do the Browser Developer Tools steps above and tell me:

1. **Any failed requests** in Network tab when trying sign-up
2. **Any failed requests** in Network tab when trying password reset
3. **Any red errors** in Console tab
4. **HTTP status codes** of failed requests (500, 400, etc.)
5. **Error messages** when you click on failed requests

## 🎯 **This Will Tell Us Exactly What's Failing**

The error messages you get from the Network tab will show us:

- **500 errors** = Server/database/configuration issues
- **400 errors** = Request format/validation issues
- **CORS errors** = Cross-origin request issues
- **Timeout errors** = Network/performance issues
