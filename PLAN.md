# TAAXDOG Web App Development Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for building the TAAXDOG web app, a SAAS finance platform for tax reports and financial management. The app uses Firebase for user data, Basiq for banking transactions, DocuClipper for receipt scanning, DevExpress Dashboard API for data visualization, and Claude 3.7 for financial insights. Cursor will refer to this plan for every prompt, following each step sequentially to ensure systematic development.

### Current Progress (As of March 2025)
We have successfully completed Phases 1-6, including UI Development, Banking Integration, Receipt Scanning, and Data Dashboard implementation. The current application features:

1. **Complete Dashboard UI** with responsive design and sidebar navigation
2. **Banking Integration Interface** with connect, refresh, and delete functionality
3. **Financial Goals Tracking** with progress visualization
4. **Notifications System** for updates and alerts
5. **Receipt Scanning and Processing** with matching to transactions
6. **Data Visualization Dashboard** with charts showing financial insights
7. **Interactive Elements** including modals and forms with validation
8. **Development Infrastructure** with hot-reloading for efficient development

Next steps will focus on implementing Financial Analysis with Claude 3.7 (Phase 7, starting with step 7.1).

### Guidelines for Development
- Keep all files under 100 lines with clear comments for readability.
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables).
- Securely manage sensitive data (API keys, tokens) using environment variables.
