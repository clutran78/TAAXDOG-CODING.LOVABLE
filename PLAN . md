# TAAXDOG Web App Development Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for building the TAAXDOG web app, a SAAS finance platform for tax reports and financial management. The app uses Firebase for user data, Basiq for banking transactions, DocuClipper for receipt scanning, DevExpress Dashboard API for data visualization, and Claude 3.7 for financial insights. Cursor will refer to this plan for every prompt, following each step sequentially to ensure systematic development.

### Guidelines for Development
- Keep all files under 100 lines with clear comments for readability.
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables).
- Securely manage sensitive data (API keys, tokens) using environment variables.
